# Hello World 🌍

My name is Effie Njoki and I'm a passionate Software Developer. I write high-quality, modular and maintainable code, based on the industry's best practices. I thrive in designing and implementing solutions that allow humans to effectively interact with machines.

- 🌍 I'm based in Nairobi, Kenya
- 🌱 I’m currently: Collaborating in Django & ReactNative projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I organize my code snippets into a "virtual treasure chest." It's my go-to stash of clever solutions and time-saving hacks. 💎🧰
